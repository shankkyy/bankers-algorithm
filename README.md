# 🏦 Banker's Algorithm Simulator

Welcome to the **Banker's Algorithm Simulator**! This application is designed to help users understand and visualize the Banker's Algorithm, which is used in operating systems to manage resource allocation and avoid deadlock.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Simulation**: Visualize how the Banker's Algorithm allocates resources and prevents deadlocks.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface built with React and React Bootstrap.
- **Customizable Input**: Easily input different scenarios to see how the algorithm responds.

## 🛠️ Usage

After starting the application, you can interact with the simulator to input various resource allocation scenarios. The app will demonstrate how the Banker's Algorithm manages resources and avoids deadlock situations.

## 📖 Understanding the Banker's Algorithm

The Banker's Algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm. It tests for safety by simulating the allocation of predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, and then makes a "safe-state" check to test for possible activities before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

### Key Concepts:

- **Available**: The number of available instances of each resource.
- **Max**: The maximum demand of each process.
- **Allocation**: The number of resources of each type currently allocated to each process.
- **Need**: The remaining resource needs of each process.
